# TwoThreeTree-master-app
This project features implementations of several distinct tree structures: TwoThreeTree, SemiSplay TwoThreeTree, and a Bottom-Up SemiSplay TwoThreeTree. The SemiSplay TwoThreeTree is a variant based on the semi splay tree data structure, a novel concept that combines the principles of semi-splay trees into a two-three tree.
